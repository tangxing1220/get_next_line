If you choose to submit this project using your library libft, it is strictly FORBIDDEN \n
to bypass the limitation of the Norm by adding some specific functions from \n
your get_next_line. That would be considered cheating during your defence. Your \n
get_next_line must hold in 5 functions of 25 lines max. The respect of this \n
instruction will be carefully checked during your defence. There is no need for \n
you ask permission to the staff to add a function to your library. Use your head instead \n
and ask yourself if your function respects this instruction. If you do everything right, \n
you will of course be encouraged to expand your library with generic functions. \n
Youâ€™ll discover their usage as you complete this project.
